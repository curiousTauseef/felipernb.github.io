Hey there!

If you used to read my old blog in the past it might look weird that it's now empty and in English, but have no fear, the old content will remain available at [http://old.feliperibeiro.com](http://old.feliperibeiro.com).

The idea of this new blog is to have it more active, more technical and in English. Since I've been living abroad and having contact with hackers from many countries for the last two years, it made no sense to keep writing just in pt-BR.

This won't be a blog about any specific language, my idea is to just post random geeky things, related to IT career, hacks, tech book reviews, tips & tricks and anything that can possible come in handy for myself or someone else later on.

So, I hope I can keep up with this idea and try to share some awesome stuff here :)
